# ManaEngine - 2d in 3d game engine for Windows 10 and up

## TODO:
* ManaCommon static lib
  * remove the CommonStuff call in ManaGame and test other scenarios having to do with referencing the same lib twice:
    (ManaGame references ManaCommon.lib directly, and indirectly via ManaEngine.lib):
    * Make sure the global ptr has same addr in both the common lib and here.
    * Call the same function in ManaCommon directly from ManaGame and indirectly via ManaEngine.
    * If ManaEngine sets some data in Common, does ManaGame see the same values?
* audio engine - re-org
  * DONE-Remove libopenmpt (We won't be using mod files.)
  * DONE-Get gameloop running when dragging the window.
     -See: https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=287698

    * try getting separate thread working??? See example:
        C:\Users\gglas\Desktop\run-game-in-thread-example.cpp

      * Use a queue that generic messages can be posted to.
        * Lock the queue somehow efficiently.
          * Can we just use an `std::atomic<bool>` queueHasData?
            Is this "correct", even though the queue is a separate data structure?
          * Maybe just use SynchronizedQueue first (which uses a CriticalSection),
            and if the performance becomes a problem, then we can worry about
            optimizing later. Don't want to spend too much time optimizing first.

  * NOT-DOING-Move code from AudioWin::Play into AudioFileOggWin::Load.
    * DONE-Play (for non-looping, streaming sounds) should only be "resuming" the current buffers, not resetting any positions.
      ... Stop causes issues with the audio thread. Need to figure out a way to sync them up cleanly somehow.
      ... otherwise, might need to make it single threaded!!!! similar to https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/496350-xaudio2-and-ogg/
    * Stop should clear voice's queues, reset position back to start, and seek to start, so it prepares for next call to "Play".
      * This also might need to be called from audio thread at end of non-looping streaming file?
    * TEST-Pause should only "stop" the voices and not change any positions.
    * DONE-Resume should only call "Play" on the voices.
  * Get static ogg working (then we can remove wav!)

* Thread functionality
    * DONE-interface/factory: See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38078450/hiding-specific-implementation-of-c-interface
    * DONE-Create thread
    * DONE-run code on thread (queue with lock?)
    * DONE-Stop thread
    * DONE-Dealloc/close thread
    * ON-HOLD-Suspend/Resume - maybe use a waitfunction, instead of the SuspendThread/ResumeThread functions (since those are only intended for use with debuggers and can cause deadlocks if a function tries to wait on a critical section)
* File functionality
    * DONE-GetFileSize
    * ReadAllBytes into memory
        * Pass in a "Cancellation Token"
    * NO-Use overlapped io?
        * OVERLAPPED structure - You can also create an event and put the handle in the OVERLAPPED structure; the wait functions can then be used to wait for the I/O operation to complete by waiting on the event handle.
            * FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED
        * CancelIo â€” this function only cancels operations issued by the calling thread for the specified file handle.
        * The ReadFileEx and WriteFileEx functions enable an application to specify a routine to execute (see FileIOCompletionRoutine) when the asynchronous I/O request is completed. (instead of using a wait-function).
* audio engine
    * DONE-Call CreateSourceVoice "SimultaniousSounds" times within Load and store in vector, and Play can loop through them.
    * DONE-IsPlaying, IsPaused
    * DONE-Stop, StopAll
    * DONE-Pause, PauseAll, Resume, ResumeAll
    * DONE-AudioCategory = {SoundFx, Music, Voice} - allows us to control a group of related sounds with volume or mute/unmute.
    * DONE-AudioLoadType = {Static, Streaming}
    * DONE-AudioFormat = {Wav, Ogg Mod}
    * DONE-SetVolume (of all voices of a specific file), SetVolume (by AudioCategory), SetMasterVolume (sets master voice volume - affects all files)
    * DONE-SetPan: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/how-to--pan-a-sound
    * NO-MuteAll (save current volumes), UnmuteAll (restore current volumes)
        * While global IsMuted, newly created sounds should be created with the volume 0, while their "last volume" should be set to 1.0f.
    * DONE-IsPlaying, IsPaused
    * DONE-allow to play looped (and specify loop sample range)
    * NO-Stop a looping sound (could call Voice::ExitLoop, but most use-cases can probably just call Stop)
    * DONE-function to unload file
    * DONE-function to unload XAudio2
    * LATER-Pitch functions? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/xaudio2-volume-and-pitch-control#pitch-control (Voice->SetFrequencyRatio)
    * NO-Seek function? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649023/how-to-seek-to-a-position-in-milliseconds-using-xaudio2
        * May never need this, since we support a loop region in Play.
    * stream libopenmpt through xaudio2
        * DONE-Create thread for updating the audio streams.
        * DONE-During loads, create thread for loading.
            * DONE-Load(mod) reads entire mod file into memory.
            * -Create streaming buffers and pass to XAudio2
                * DONE-looping
                * DONE-move streaming buffer creation from Load to Play!
                * TODO: HERE!!!-reset AudioFile fields when stop/pause, etc (such as "pFile->currentBufPos = 0;", reset libopenmpt mod position to start, etc.)
                * -Add any locking necessary.
                * -test Play, Stop, Pause of mod and wav.
            * DONE-Delete streaming buffers
            * DONE-Use a single wait-event object for all streams to say "one of the streams needs more data")
            * DONE-Sets up XAudio2 voice-callback for when stream is ready for more data to be buffered.
            * DONE-In the "VoiceStreamNeedsMoreDataCallback", set the signaled state of the "I need more data" wait event that's waiting in the update-thread.
        * update-thread waits on multiple stream event objects.
            * When the event object is signaled, it passes next chunk from memory to the uncompress/create pcm data.
              And fills streaming buffer with that pcm data. Then ResetEvent and wait again.
    * stream ogg vorbis through xaudio2 (see notes after code in Game Coding Complete)
    * some way to handle copying the xaudio dll to the game folder. Post build step, or one-time setup script?
    * Test running on Windows 7 laptop to make sure all used XAaudio2.9 api calls are supported.
    * LATER-static load ogg vorbis through xaudio2 (see code in Game Coding Complete)
    * LATER-GetLengthMillis (see code in Game Coding Complete - or can probably calculate it ourselves.)

* ManaEngine_OLD has `ManaServerConsole.cpp` (winsock)


## How to create a new Static Library project:

THIS IS OUTDATED.

-Create folders under GameDev root:
  ManaEngine
    docs    -Internal docs/notes.
    lib     -Static lib output. Only needed for static lib projects.
    inc     -Header files for static lib. Only needed for static lib projects.
    src     -C++ files
      msvc  -Visual Studio specific files. Solution/project files, etc.
    temp    -Temp compiler files.
    test    -Utilities for testing.

-Create new Visual Studio 2019 project:
  -static library (c++)
    Project Name: ManaEngine
    Location: D:\Users\gglas\Devel\Gamedev\ManaEngine\src\msvc
    Check checkbox "Place solution and project in the same directory"
    Click Next.

-In File Explorer:
  -Move `framework.h` to the `inc` folder.
  -Move `ManaEngine.cpp` to the `src` folder.

-In solution explorer:
  Consolidate Headers and Source filters into new `src` filter.
  Update the newly moved files to be under the new `src` filter.

-In project properties:
  -Fix intelisense issue for when `#include`ing the `pch.h` header file:
    See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12770937/341942

  -Select `All configurations` and `All Platforms`, then set the following:
    -General -> Output Directory: `$(ProjectDir)..\..\..\lib\$(PlatformName)$(Configuration)\`
    -General -> Intermediate Directory: `$(ProjectDir)..\..\..\temp\$(ProjectName)$(PlatformName)$(Configuration)\`
    -VC++ Directories -> Edit -> New Line: `$(ProjectDir)`
    -VC++ Directories -> Edit -> New Line: `$(ProjectDir)..\..\..\inc\` (and move it just under `$(ProjectDir)`)
    -C/C++ -> General -> Warning: `Level 4 (/W4)`

-Create a "Profile" build configuration:
  -Build menu -> Configurations -> Active solution configuration -> New
    -Name: Profile
    -Copy settings from: Debug
    -Click OK

-In project properties:
  -Select Configuration `Profile` and Platform `Win32`, then set the following:
    -C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions: Replace `_DEBUG` with `NDEBUG` (it should look same as `Release`)
  -Select Configuration `Profile` and Platform `x64`, then set the following:
    -C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions: Replace `_DEBUG` with `NDEBUG` (it should look same as `Release`)

-Build all configurations.


## Additional Engine info:

* Uses XAudio2 (v2.9):
    * It comes pre-installed on Windows 10. The redistributable is only needed for older versions of Windows.
      ManaEngine targets Windows 10+, but it appears that the redist (nuget package) gets updated somewhat often,
      and it's easier to manage with the nuget package.
      See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/xaudio2-versions
    * For how to compile with XAudio 2,
      see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/xaudio2-redistributable#compiling-your-app
    * Nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.XAudio2.Redist/
      The Nuget package is included in both `ManaEngine` and `ManaGame` projects.
      Note that the Nuget package has `.targets` files that handle linking to the XAudio lib file,
      but only for Release and Debug configurations! So Profile configuration probably won't work with it.
      Be sure to check for updates to the nuget package from time to time and test it.
    * Manual package install instructions: (NOT NEEDED/USED)
        * Rename nuget package to `.zip` extension and extract files under `ManaEngine\third-party\xaudio2`.
        * Add include folder to include search paths, above the Windows SDK, so it uses this version instead.
        * Add Release lib folder for ALL configurations. The `.targets` file in the nuget package has a comment that says to do this, since the Debug version hasn't been well tested.
    * Known issues: Not all calls are compatible with Xbox One. Not compatible with UWP apps.
